/* it is a type of linear datastructure that makes collection of nodes.
node=" data|next node address"
3|.      5|.    5 having some address that pointed by . of 3 etc
vector is a type of dynamic array.
need of linked list= 
                    1)we can not edit in array at the runtime. 
                    2)we egnore vector because it takes time and not provide optimam solution for array.
                    3)No Memory loss. 
                    4)Dynamic data structure.
                    5)Insertion and deltetion easy.
Types of linked list=
                    1) Singly linkedlist.
                    2)Doubly linked list.
                    3)Circuler Linked List.
                    3)Circuler doubly linked list.*/
